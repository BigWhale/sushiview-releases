# SushiView

A bloat-free, minimal PDF reader for Android. No AI, no cloud sync.

Just PDF reading.


## The story

I wanted a simple PDF reader for my TTRPG manuals. They all sucked, so I sort of made my own (see XKCD 927).


## Download

[![Download APK](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-APK-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=android)](https://github.com/BigWhale/sushiview-releases/releases/latest/download/SushiView.apk)


## Features (as if ...)

- PDF rendering with vertical scrolling
- Table of contents navigation with browser-style back/forward
- Last reading position restored on re-open (hopefully)
- Minimal permissions; only file access
- No ads, no tracking, no internet required


## Screenshots

A couple of screenshots from Android emulator, just to show you how utterly boring is this reader.

## Requirements

Android 11 (API 30) or higher


## Known Issues

Closing a document when content is zoomed-in, and opening some other document, will carry the zoom
level from the previous document. 


## Support

If you find SushiView somewhat useful, you can buy me a coffee!

Disclaimer: I don't drink coffee, I will spend the money on cheap electronics.
